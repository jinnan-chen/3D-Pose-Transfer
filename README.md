# Weakly-supervised 3D Pose Transfer with Keypoints (ICCV2023)
Code for Weakly-supervised 3D Pose Transfer with Keypoints.
The model consists of the followwing steps:

1.Keypoint detection
2.Inverse IK
3.Motion propagation
4.Mesh refinement

Detailed documentation will be updated.

This code is based on KeypointDeformer:https://github.com/tomasjakab/keypoint_deformer and HybrIK: https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/HybrIK
